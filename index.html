      <p>Hello Hoomans!!! Greetings!!! We(Lilo, Stitch, Zara & Nimbus) adopted this Hooman 2 years ago and we treat him with lot of love and care. He is very hard to train, has very low IQ so we have to bark/meow at times to make him understand what we’re trying to say. I don’t think he enjoys much cleaning the stuff after our business or keeping the house free of our fur, don’t worry we will train him soon.</p>
       <p> Lilo & Stitch: We were roaming free on farms very far off from here(Close to St.Louis) and one day we decided to adopt a Hooman so we went to a local shelter and asked them to advertise about us on a website… rest is history!!!</p>
       <p>Zara & Nimbus: We are Georgians all through our life… we went to Petsmart shelter and observing all for a right match. Saw this person doing whatever Lilo & Stitch were asking and getting them groomed regularly… so we cast an Enchanted spell and rest is history… poor hooman he stopped going to Petsmart afterwards…</p>
        
       <p>That’s all folks!</p>
